Model Description
=================

Introduction
------------

Model consists of road network and cars. Road network itself consists of road
stretches, crossroads, endpoints and traffic lights. Further I will refer to
road stretches simply as roads. Think of roads as a vectors - they cannot
contain crosses in the midlle, if you need to add a crossroad in the middle
then you ultimatly need to split it into two parts and connect them with
crossroad. Additional roads can be added to the crossroad thus making it a real
crossing. Cars can enter and exit model only at endpoins. Each road connect two
and only two points (either crossroads and/or endpoints). Road ending cannot
hang "in the air" it must be connected to some point. Endpoint can be connected
to only one road. Crossroad can be connected to any number of roads, however
current movement algorithm supposes that there are no more than 4 road
stretches (normal X-crossing of two roads in terms of real life). Obviously
crossroad linking two roads doesn't make much sense and can be removed.

Cars are placed on roads. This is a car-following model so each car move
behaviour solely depends on the distance to the nearest obstacle - another car
or traffic light. They can also change lines if another line provides better
oportunities to move.

At each step each car defines it behaviour for this step and evaluates changes
to its state. These changes are applied only at the end of the step, so each
car uses the same input date while determining its behavior.
